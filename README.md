# QTHelloWorld Project

The goal for this repo is to demonstrate a simple QT app, but with better illustration of how a real world, working QT application would look like.

In other words, simple but not so basic it can't really be used to make a functional, distributable app.

Perhaps it can serve as a good lauch point for anyone who wants to make a functional QT program.  **Good luck!**
