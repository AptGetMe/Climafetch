### See the current outdoor climate like [wthrr](https://github.com/ttytm/wthrr-the-weathercrab) or [wego](https://github.com/schachmat/wego) but display it like [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)

Climafetch aims to be an easy to use weather app that retrieves the current weather conditions and display them in a linux bash terminal. While Climafetch is pretty simple to use, please don't hesitate to check documentation for help installing and using it! Currently under development, but a release may be happening soon...
