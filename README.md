# QTHelloWorld Project
The goal for this repo is to demonstrate a simple QT app, but with more examples
of how a real world, working application would look like.

In other words, simple but not so basic it can't be used to make a functional app.

Perhaps it can serve as a good lauch point for a functional QT program.
